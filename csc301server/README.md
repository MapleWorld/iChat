# How to run the server

* Create the file config/db.json. There is an example file shown to demonstrate the format.
This file holds the database connection configuration.

* Add all of the JARs in the lib/ directory to the build path in Eclipse (project options -> build path)

* Currently the server is hard-coded to run on port 8080. Later this will be defined in a config file.
