For the upcoming project, we plan on implementing an Android version of the messaging application for universities. A quick poll among the team was done to decide the platform and the project. We came to an unanimous decision on the messaging application since this project presented an opportunity to produce the highest quality final product considering the amount of time required with a lot of potential opportunities to extend the original features.


<h2>Product Description</h2>

Our product is an Android version of the messaging application for universities. At the first release, the users of our application will be able to own their personal accounts on our server and use their account to interact with activities/services we provide, which means there are basic <b>register</b> and <b>log in</b> actions provided connecting our sql server. Once logged in, any user can enjoy our service provided in app such as <b>View Categories</b> which lists all currently available Categories they might be interested in. Users can then click on any Category to <b>view all the Topics</b> within that category.  By doing so, users filter futher down to <b>view threads</b> of that specific topic.
