Uncheck "use default location"

Set location to the "csc301server" folder inside of Phase2

Do not copy files into workspace

Finish project creation

If there are 3 jars listed, then we don't need to add them.
Otherwise, use "Add External JARs" to add the 3 jars in the
csc301server/lib folder to the project.

Click Add Class Folder, and point it at the csc301server/config
directory.

Click OK. 

Create the file csc301server/config/db.json and configure it
with the parameters for your local MySQL instance.

In Eclipse, select the org.csc301team6.server package.

Click Run, then run it as a Java Application

You can test it by visiting localhost:8080 with a web browser.
