<h1>Scrum process report</h1>
Our planning and review meetings are mostly done online, its more convenien, and solves time conflicts. <br>
There was one planning meeting at very beginning, although not everyone showed up but our group was able to come up a plan for first release. <br>
We decided to use sql and servlet to build/host server for database communication.
<br>

Tip: You can use GitHub to label all the user stories you plan to complete during a sprint, and include a link to an issue search result (example) in your planning meeting summary.

<br>

For the review/retrospective meeting, we would like to see some numbers and/or interesting statistics.
For example: Percentage of planned work that was actually completed, distribution of completed work among team members, percentage of planned work completed categorized by priority, etc.
The point is to evaluate the estimations that you've made during the planning meeting.

<br>


Daily scrum meetings done online, many of them are helping each others. We faced problem setting up the android, connecting to server, and coding, meetings were helpful to resolve those problem and keep us going.
Please include date and location.

I have created a settings activity so that we can configure the server connection<br>
I already changed the registration activity to read the server connection settings from the preferences<br>
These changes are in the branch "https_custom". What other branches should I merge into it to make the changes?<br>
