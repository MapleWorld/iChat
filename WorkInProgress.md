Why did we choose the project?

This product will organize discussion threads into categories. The categories are broad, and are not configurable by users. Threads may be posted in a single category, and may be tagged with topic attributes. These topic tags can be used to filter posts within a category. Users can create accounts, and post new threads within a category; while posting the thread, the user may choose one or several topics to tag the thread with. The user can choose from exisitng topics, or create new tags at the time of posting. Users can save lists of topics that they are interested in, and view posts from within those topic areas.
