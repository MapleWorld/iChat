# Phase 4 - Process

The software development process that worked well for our team was the Scrum-like process. In our situation, it was easiest to split the work into 2 sprints per phase. The first sprint would be to work on the server component followed by the client component. During each of the sprint, the sprint meeting allowed us to plan out important implementation decisions for the upcoming tasks such as the system architecture. In addition, daily scrums meetings allowed team members to ask questions and get help on any difficulties they are currently facing. One thing from Scrum that didn't work well for our team was the stand-up meeting since we weren't able to find a suitable time slot where everyone would be available for a quick meeting. To resolve this, we settled with leaving messages on a group chat, which allowed us to effectively communicate. On the other hand, Kanban provided a more flexible development process, but it didn't work as effective as the Scrum-like process. We found it harder to balance the workload of the team between the different tasks available. It was more logical and effective to have sprints focused on server and client implementations since client implementations often depend on the server implementations.

Furthermore, we found the GitHub issue management system to be an effective way to track and assign tasks for the different phases. We were able to label tasks with a given phase or a descriptive label such as "bug" or "enhancement". Team members would be able to effectively visual what tasks needed to be completed, and take on tasks that they were interested in.

If we were to continue working as a team, the ideal process would be similar to Scrum:
 * Having many cycles so we can split up large projects
 * Frequent meetings done online
 * Frequent status checks to keep up with the goals
 * Utilize GitHub's issue management system to track and assignment tasks
 * Utilize GitHub's pull request system to ensure every commit to master is peer reviewed and ensure code conflicts are rebased correctly
