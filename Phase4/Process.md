# Phase 4 - Process

The software development process our team ended up using was Scrum, we couldn't follow scrum process exactly
becase our situation differ from real world development teams.
However, we did mostly follow the process of Scrum, we have divided work into many cycles, and this worked particular
well for our team, because we were able to deliver different phases of our product. Each phase we have set of goals
to achieve and that split the this large project into smaller pieaces.
One thing from Scrum that didn't work well for our team was the stand-up meeting, we couldn't find suitble time slot
everyday that everyone can attend the quick meeting. But we did use an alternative solution which is leaving
Notes/messages on facebook chat group, this way every group member is updated when logging on.

If we were to continue working as a team, the ideal process would be similar to Scrum:
  * Having many cycles so we can split up large projects.
  * Frequent meetings done online, no necessary presence required.
  * Frequent status check to keep up with the goals.
  * Use of issue management to assign tasks and divide work load.
