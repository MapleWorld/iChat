# Individual Reports

## Name (GitHub username)

Here is an example of a fake report, just to give you an idea of the format we are expecting.
We would like you to be concise yet informative.

 * My most significant contrubution was the design and implementation of Component X (links to relevant and interesting source-files/commits/issues).
 * While working on our Android app (and then later in class), I learned about adapters (links to relevant and interesting source-files/commits/issues).
 * I am always helping my teammates - I am the most experienced coder on the team, and I helped other teammates set up their development environment, and get up to speed with the tools we've used (give examples of specific tools).
 * I could keep people more informed of what I am doing - I made a few large commits that conflicted with everybody else's code, and merging everything wasted a lot of our time.

* My most significant contribution was the implementation of the basic server design, which we re-used for much of the server functionality as it was expanded. This is where we laid out the core functionality for handling HTTP requests, communicating with MySQL, processing JSON, and reading config from a file. Most of this was implemented in commit: [70a1c72b9675af10e8147cb1babfced896e8b669](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team6-repo/commit/70a1c72b9675af10e8147cb1babfced896e8b669)
* I had to do some work to figure out how to implement SSL/TLS for HTTPS on the Android client. This involved using the Java standard library's cryptography functions along with some of the Android APIs. Since Java's API for these features was not straightforward, the experience I gained figuring it out would allow me to accomplish it faster on a future project. This was implemented in commit (see CSC301ConnectionManager.java): [60a0d7b8f0f3a9bec92d32ae5239eea939a13615](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Evening-Team6-repo/commit/60a0d7b8f0f3a9bec92d32ae5239eea939a13615)
* My strength as a team member was in trying to ensure that all of my code was tested before committing it. I wanted to avoid causing confusion for other team members by making sure my code did not produce errors when they pulled it, and I also made sure not to commit autogenerated binary files which do not belong in the repo. I never ran "git commit -a", and only added files manually as required, and tried to group them into meaningful commits.
* One thing I could improve as a team member would be making better use of branches to manage my code changes. I tended to use a single branch to make a large variety of changes for my own convenience, but other team members may find the changes easier to manage if they are spread across more branches.
