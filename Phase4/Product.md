# Phase 4 - Product

Our product is an android messaging application targeted at university students. The product focuses on a forum based interaction, where users navigate to threads by a particular category such as "Computer Science", and can further filter by topics such as "CSC301" within a category. We have a basic user authentication system to allow users to identify themselves and keep track of their own messages safely. Our application allows users to create and view categories, topics, and threads which allow for the optimial user experience. Users can filter threads based on categories and topics so they can easily identify the threads that they would like to see. When creating a thread, a user can add these categories and topics to their thread to allow other viewers to easily find their thread. Besides the user side, we also focused on the administration side of the application. We allowed some users to have administrative privileges which gives them the ability to delete threads that they felt offensive and ban abusive users from the system. Once a user is finished using the application, they can easily log out of the application and have their data saved for the next time they use the application.
