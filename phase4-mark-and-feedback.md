 * Good intro. Mentioning StackOverflow as an "inspiration" gives the audience a frame of reference.
 * Very good architecture discussion - Clear high-level description, and also goes into a fair bit of details.
 * I liked your answer to the question about how to test the client without a server.
 * Good description of the process - Focused on highlights, goes into a few additional details, and explaining some of the difficulties.
 * Overall, great job!
