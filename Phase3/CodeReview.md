NOTE: This is an example of a good format for a code review - It is very short, yet very informative (assuming you actually include links). You don't have to follow this format, but it can give you an idea of what we want to see - Short description of highlights, and links to isses/commits/pull-requests that allow us to get more details.

 * I found several minor bugs (_links to issues_), and managed to fix a few of them (_links to commits or pull-requests_).
 * I suggested an improvement to the design of _component X_ (for more details, _link to issue_), as well as some additional useful features (_links to issues_).
 * I thought that the implementation of _component Y_ was very elegant - 
The use of _interface Z_ (_link to source file_) made it really easy to add _component Y_ to the rest of the system.

You can see all of my comments by searching for issues with the label _code-review-MyGitHubUsername_ (_link to search results_).

 * I found server minors bugs in server.java file and tried to fix it in commit 6638f4c70e35d6bc6be4da2b78d886b9074c3320, 6e92fbf140a03872643fd7d607e27880a8edadae, and e33fd90412810c7943dfb4ce32b30e40b1bd762c for #29 And commit bc3100ea0564f2c7d216cba6665a2ebb9b91ec29, also, there are duplicate code in the server.java file for createThread and downloadUrl, which I recommend to split it into smaller methods.
 * Another bug that I found fixed was in commit bc3100ea0564f2c7d216cba6665a2ebb9b91ec29 DAO.java file and was mentioned in #41.
 * Regarding about #62 ViewTopicListByCategoryActivity.java, I find there are too much code in onCreate method and should be break down into smaller methods for readability and extensibility. 
 * I thought that the implementation of #60 (_6083920d3433eafbf7f10b4714927d235d9529e7_) was very elegant. There is no duplicate code between the method and really compact, making it really easy to follow and understand.
